### `Como começar ?` 
  *   Faça o clone do repositorio https://github.com/AndreMotta25/solarEnergy.git
  *   Com o vsCode aberto, vá ao terminal e digite npm install, assim as dependencias do projeto vão ser instaladas(esse processo pode demorar).
  *   Com tudo instalado devidamente, vá ao terminal e digite npm run server(para iniciar o servidor) e numa outra aba do terminal digite npm start(pra rodar o app), 
  note, você tem que fazer isso em diferentes abas do terminal.
  *   Agora é so testar a aplicação.
  Se tudo ocorrer bem depois que você passar pela tela de login,você terá uma tela semelhante a está abaixo:

### `Atualizações`
 - Inseri a pagina notfound para caso o usuario entre numa pagina que não existe.
 - Fiz algumas melhorias em outras partes do codigo, visando uma melhor leitura do mesmo.  
 - Mudei a estrutura das paginas, antes eu chamava o menu e o titulo em cada pagina, agora temos uma pagina generica que ja contem os dois.
  
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
